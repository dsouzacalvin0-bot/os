# week 1 System Planning and Distribution Selection

  # Introduction

Phase 1 focuses on planning a virtual operating system deployment and justifying the technical decisions made at this early stage of the project. The aim is to design a simple but effective dual-system architecture that supports secure remote administration and provides a foundation for later security and performance testing.

This phase outlines the overall system architecture, including a headless Linux server and a separate workstation used to access the server via SSH. It also explains the reasoning behind the chosen server distribution and workstation setup, along with the virtual network configuration used to allow controlled communication between the two systems.

Finally, basic system information is gathered using standard command-line tools to confirm the initial configuration of both systems. This establishes a clear baseline that will be referenced in later phases as the system is secured, monitored, and tested under different workloads.
