# week 7 Security Audit and System Evaluation

# Introduction 
Phase 7 focuses on reviewing the security of the system after all configuration and testing has been completed. The aim is to check how secure the server is and to see if there are any remaining issues that need attention.

In this phase, security scans are run using Lynis and network checks are carried out with nmap to see what is visible from the outside. SSH settings, access control, and running services are also reviewed to make sure they are set up correctly and that only necessary services are enabled.

The findings from these checks are documented in a security audit report, along with any improvements made and a discussion of remaining risks. This final phase helps to evaluate the overall security of the system and reflect on what has been learned during the project.


# Security scanning with Lynis:
Lynis was used to scan the system for security weaknesses and misconfigurations. It provides a security score and recommendations for improving the system.

# Network security assessment with nmap:
nmap was used to check open ports and running services to ensure only necessary network services were accessible.

# Access control verification:
Access control settings were reviewed to confirm that user permissions and security policies were correctly enforced.

# Service audit:
All running services were checked to identify which services were active and to justify why each one was required.

# System configuration review:
The overall system configuration was reviewed to ensure security settings were applied correctly and followed best practices.
