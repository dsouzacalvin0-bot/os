# week 3 Application Selection for Performance Testing

#Introduction

Phase 3 focuses on selecting a range of applications that can be used to evaluate system performance under different types of workload. The purpose of this phase is to ensure that the server is tested in a realistic and structured way, covering multiple aspects of operating system behaviour rather than relying on a single test.

This section introduces the chosen applications, each representing a different workload type such as CPU-intensive, memory-intensive, disk I/O-intensive, network-intensive, and server-based workloads. An application selection matrix is used to justify why each tool or service was chosen and what part of the system it is expected to stress.

The phase also documents the installation process for each application using SSH and command-line tools only. In addition, expected resource usage is outlined to provide a reference point for later performance testing, along with a monitoring strategy that explains how CPU, memory, disk, and network activity will be measured for each application during testing.
